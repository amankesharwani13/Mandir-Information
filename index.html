          India being part of the world’s oldest civilizations is a land of rich
          history, countless beliefs, traditions and legends surrounding the
          religions. India takes pride in the country’s rich cultural and
          religious history as it is the birth land of the traditions of
          Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism. India is a land where people
          of different religious beliefs live in harmony and brotherhood.
          Hinduism is believed to be the world’s oldest religion. Unlike other
          religions, Hinduism does not have a founder but is instead a fusion of
          religions. Various ancient manuscripts and scholars describe the
          religion as a traditional way of living, a religion whose beginning
          and ending cannot be traced.

          <p>
            Situated close to the Alaknanda River, the abode of Lord Badrinath
            is located in the Chamoli district of Uttarakhand. This holy shrine
            of Lord Vishnu is one of the Char Dhams of Hindu religion. It is
            also one of the four Chota Char Dham pilgrimage sites (comparatively
            minor pilgrimage sites). The temple is one of the 108 temples
            dedicated to Lord Vishnu (Divya Desams), which finds its mention in
            the works of Tamil saints who existed in the 6th to 9th century. The
            ancient abode of Lord Vishnu can be visited only between the months
            of April and November because the temple remains closed during the
            other months due to harsh weather conditions.

        <h1>Sun Temple, Odisha</h1>
        <h3>
          <p>
            The Sun temple is situated in the small town of Konark situated in
            the Puri district of Odisha. This marvel of architecture is
            dedicated to Indian God of Sun, Surya. The temple has been built in
            the shape of his chariot which is drawn by seven horses. The temple
            was built in the 13th century by a king called Narasimhadeva. There
            is an ancient legend attached to this temple, once Lord Krishna
            cursed one of his own sons with leprosy. To seek penance, his son,
            Samba worshiped Surya for twelve years. Pleased with his devotion,
            Surya healed him. Samba made the Sun temple in return to express his
            gratitude. The mesmerizing beauty of the place was best summed up by
            Rabindranath Tagore: ‘Here the language of stone surpasses the
            language of man.’

          <p>
            Brihadeeswara Temple is one of the largest South-Indian temples
            situated in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu. Also known as Peruvudaiyar Kovil
            and RajaRajeswaram, this 11th century temple was built by the Chola
            emperor Raja Raja Chola I. Cholas are known for their admiration for
            art. The opulence and artistic proficiency of Cholas is well
            reflected in the grand and magnificent architecture of the temple.
            Made entirely of granite stone, it was built as per the principles
            of Vaastu Shastra. The most remarkable thing about this UNESCO World
            Heritage Site is that it doesn’t leave any shadow on the ground at
            noon. Dedicated to Lord Shiva, the temple speaks of the importance
            of religious beliefs in Hinduism.

          <p>
            Somnath Temple is one of the oldest pilgrimage centres in India and
            finds mention in the ancient books of Shiv Puran, Skanda Purana and
            Shreemad Bhagvat Gita. Soma refers to ‘Moon God’, thus Somnath means
            ‘Protector of the Moon God’. According to a legend, the Indian God
            of Moon, Soma was cursed by his father-in-law to lose his lustre. It
            was Lord Shiva who cured his illness and later Soma built this
            temple in his honour. It is one of the most revered ‘jyotirlinga’
            among the 12 jyotirlingas of India. The temple is located in Prabhas
            Kshetra in Saurashtra (Gujarat). Prabhas Kshetra is where Lord
            Krishna is believed to have left his mortal body. The place also has
            a Somnath museum, Junagadh gate, beach and a sound and light show to
            amuse the pilgrims.

          <p>
            Situated in the Himalayan range of Garhwal (Uttarakhand), Kedarnath temple is one of the most sacred shrines in the world. The holy abode of Shiva is believed to have been built by the Pandavas to atone for their sins during Mahabharata.

            The temple was restored by Adi Sankaracharya in the 8th century. It is one of the Chota Char Dhams of Uttarakhand and requires the pilgrims to trek a distance of 14 kms on the hilly terrain.
            
            Standing at a height of 3,583 metres, surrounded by the glaciers and snow-clad peaks, the temple is closed during winters due to severe weather conditions. Even the idol of Lord Shiva is shifted to Ukhimath during the months the temple remains closed.

        <h1>Ramanathaswamy Temple</h1>
        <h3>
          <p>
            Rameswaram is a small island town in Tamil Nadu known for being one of the pious Char Dhams of the Hindus. As per the legend, Lord Rama with his wife Sita landed on the shore of this island after defeating the demon king, Ravana who was a brahmin.

            To seek atonement for killing a brahmin, Lord Rama wanted to pray to Lord Shiva. He asked Hanuman to fly to Kailash and bring a Shivalinga. In the meantime, Goddess Sita made a small lingam. The one made by Goddess Sita is called Ramalingam and one brought by Lord Hanuman is called Vishwalingam.
            
            As per the instructions of Lord Rama, Vishwalingam has to be worshipped before the Ramalingam which is followed even today.
